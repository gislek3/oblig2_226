<h2>Change 1: Something very stupid</h2>
Removed a debug statement that allows anyone to log into any user with the password "debug" lmao:<br>

<h2>Change 2:</h2>

I have added the generated CSP nonces to login and profile htmls. These are generated in app.py before each request is made:

But I have to expand the after_request in order to actually define the CSP header (otherwise it's just a floating nonce):

Note that it's actually not very good to allow unsafe inline and this would technically remove most of our security benefits, but I was not able to figure out how to whitelist via style nonces or any of the other typical techniques in order to both properly display user profiles AND have security. It does prevent injections via the user URL though.

<h2>Change 3: Acces Control users/{userid}</h2>

I realised that I actually never successfully implemented access control that USES the buddy system. All it took was a small change to the get_user route:

Which results in this when trying to access a user that han't added you as a buddy:

Which is primitive but works okay.

<h2>Change 4: Storing secret key</h2>

Hiding the secret key from the user and storing it in a file called secrets, which will not be included in the git repo.

SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE is on *Strict*, because as to contribute to protect against XSS-attacks like CSRF. This value might be reviewed later. SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is *False*, because of the lack of HTTPS.
