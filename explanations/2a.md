<h2>What I've done to perform the SQL injection</h2>
The code takes the user input and tries to construct a valid authenticated user object out of it. A user's input is directly sent into an SQL query without any real safeguards. This creates the potential for a "classic" SQL injection. If I know what to do, I will have direct access to the "users" database.

Taking some inspiration from the basic examples at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation


I can potentially do extremely malicious acts, such as deleting ALL users. I will steal some information from the app itself, where some example users are stored in plaintext:
![Picture showing that the user Alice's info is stored in plaintext in app.py](https://i.imgur.com/5WrhJuk.png)
Which allows us to log in as Alice:

This is a security breach in itself (as is storing any sensitive information in plaintext),  but it's not related to SQL injection...

Using the prompt:<br>
'; DELETE FROM users; SELECT id, username, password, info FROM users WHERE username = '

Will wipe all the data from the "users table, and this is most definitely an SQL injection.

I enter it into the username field:

Then I will try to log in again as alice, just to show that it no longer works (the information is no longer in the database):

I have completely wiped out all the users in the entire database! If this was a real website with real information stored on it, this would be quite sad.

<h2>What I've done to mitigate SQL injections</h2>
Simple parameterization of statements related to the user class to escape direct user input.

Outright rjecting non-alphanumerical usernames, for sanity:

Using an external library like SQLAlchemy to specifically handle input sanitation in a catch-all manner before ANY Sql queries are executed would probably be better overall but I'm not sure what I'm allowed to do.<br><br>

Note that the info field in users.db is in JSON format. What you input there is not directly executed as SQL, although it has some issues of its own, which we will touch on in the next exercise.
