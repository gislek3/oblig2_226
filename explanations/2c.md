<h2>On the system's password</h2>
<h4>Problem 1: No password demands</h4>

You could have the password "1" or "abc", which would make the job of anyone attempting to take control of arbitrary user's profile much easier. The likelihood of multiple users having the same password increases when the constraints on the format of those passwords are looser, and most important, they are also easier to guess (thus also to brute force).<br><br>

<h4>Problem 2: No hash (with salt)</h4>
The password storage has no real security, and a great start would be to hash them. This would make it difficult to get into a user's account even if the database would be leaked. But, if it were, you can generate hashes for easily-guessable passwords ("a", "abc", "123", "hello", common words, popular names, etc.) and you'd effectively be cracking multiple passwords at the same time. With salt; identical inputs will produce different outputs (assuming that the salt is also unique). Thus you'd at most crack one at a time. This buys the cybersecurity people a lot of time.
<br><br>

<h2>Better password storage implementation</h2>



I begin by using werkzeug's built-in hashing scheme, which uses with default arguments (only taking in the plaintext password), uses:
PBKDF2 as algorithm, sha256 as function, with 600k number of iterations for the key derivation function. That's probably good enough. I apply this to all updated passwords. <br>

I also make sure to hash the existing passwords:

<br>
werkzeug also has a check_password_hash function, which works in a similar way. It just splits the salted hash and safely generates a hash using the input str with the other parameters (which are stored in the salted hash itself, in plaintext).

Replacing the existing "=="-check will mean that the system will work as intended:

<h2>Implement some form of checking of new passwords.</h2>

I can then create a simple constraint function that is meant to improve the overall quality of the system's passwords from this point onwards.

Such that when you try to create unsafe passwords (i.e., ones that don't match the regex pattern), you'll be stopped:

I then updated the existing passwords in the DB so that the system is clean. <br><br>
One can observe that alice has logged in with her new and secure password, but the actual password is not stored in the database. Instead the hashed and salted password is. Good news!

<h2>Implement an access control scheme</h2>
I expand on the existing "buddy" system, by integrating it into the User class:

![](https://i.imgur.com/KPdimoZ.png)

The goal is to use it for access control. I make it so that a user's profile information will be limited, depending on your "buddy status", which I've defined as:<br>
-1 =  self (you can see your own profile)<br>
0 =   no relation (nobody can see each other's profile)<br>
1 =   you have sent them a request (they get to see your profile)<br>
2 =   they have sent you a request (you get to see their profile)<br>
3 =   you have both sent requests, you are buddies (see each other's profiles)<br>
<br>


I incorporate this into the format_profile function:
![](https://i.imgur.com/nxm6kqb.jpg)

I want the add/remove buddy buttons to display depending on the relationship as well. I create two extra users (one of which has added alice as a friend) in order to better demonstrate the full complexity:<br>
![](https://i.imgur.com/zn0IjwT.jpg)

I made alice accept dennis' friend request and logged in as him to show it from his perspective:
![](https://i.imgur.com/IPkJ1Ty.jpg)

To make this work I also added some routes in app.py to make the buttons have full functionality:
![](https://i.imgur.com/RMCslmM.jpg)
This will only allow POSTs (and not typical GETs, which is a potential source of injections via URL-based API-bypassing). I made a similar one for removing buddies.

As it is no, one can make such an API-bypass, as dennis can still view the contents of bob's profile (even though their buddy status is 0):
![](https://i.imgur.com/eBpqB0P.jpg)

I will therefore make also make the fetch of users.html depend on the buddy status of the user's making the request:
![](https://i.imgur.com/qYvGonW.jpg)

This means that if they attempt a bypass, they will simply be shown their own page:

<h2>Is it possible for a user to change another user's profile information?</h2>
I don't know how. The only way would be to forcefully change the value of "current_user", which is beyond the scope of my abilities to execute or protect against.
